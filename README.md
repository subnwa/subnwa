Hello, I'm Efe! I am a part time open source software developer.

A few years ago, I learned that I could develop systems that people could use through code. Its purpose is to provide the best service to people and with open source code, anyone can benefit from it.

I usually try to develop background apps to be able to run most systems well. (This includes modules and some package managers)

I'm pretty new in this business, but I'm focused on improving myself and trying to do my best.

Good coding everyone! ðŸ‘‹
